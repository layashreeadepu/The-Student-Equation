# The Student Equation Project on Probability and Statistics

In this study, we use Kaggle data to comprehend how social support, anxiety, and sleep quality affect students' academic achievement. We identify correlations between social, environmental, physiological, and psychological factors using sophisticated statistical techniques. Contributing knowledge for focused interventions that improve students' academic performance and well-being is the aim.

•Extracted data from Kaggle, focusing on 20 features related to psychological, physiological, social, environmental, and academic factors.

•Organized data into social, environmental, physiological, and psychological dimensions with clear component definitions.

•Developed a comprehensive system architecture, defining components within each dimension.

•Recognized and explained random variables, acknowledging variability across the student population.

•Applied advanced statistical methods (correlation, regression) to unveil nuanced relationships within dimensions.

•Leveraged Kaggle as a cloud-based data source, showcasing familiarity with cloud platforms.

These succinct points highlight key data engineering insights from the project, demonstrating proficiency in various aspects of data analysis.
