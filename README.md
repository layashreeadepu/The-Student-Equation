# 🎓 Student Equation: Analyzing Academic Performance Using Probability & Statistics

This project investigates how **social support**, **anxiety**, and **sleep quality** impact students' academic performance. Using a Kaggle dataset, the study explores correlations among **psychological**, **physiological**, **social**, and **environmental** factors through statistical modeling.

## 🧠 Introduction

Student success is influenced by more than just study habits. This project leverages statistical tools to explore how **support systems**, **emotional well-being**, and **daily habits** impact academic outcomes.

## ❓ Problem Statement

How do **social**, **psychological**, **physiological**, and **environmental** factors influence students' academic performance?  
What statistical patterns emerge when analyzing student behavior across these domains?

---

## 📊 Data Source

- 📁 **Source**: Kaggle dataset on student mental health and lifestyle  
- 🔢 **Features**: 20+ variables including GPA, anxiety levels, hours of sleep, peer support, living environment, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Methodology

- Cleaned and structured data from Kaggle  
- Categorized features into four domains:  
  - **Social**  
  - **Psychological**  
  - **Physiological**  
  - **Environmental**
- Recognized and defined **random variables** to reflect variability across students  
- Applied statistical analyses to explore dependencies

## 🧱 System Architecture

Data was modeled into a modular framework:

| Dimension      | Sample Components                  |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Social         | Peer support, family interactions  |
| Psychological  | Anxiety, motivation                |
| Physiological  | Sleep hours, nutrition             |
| Environmental  | Study space, noise levels          |

## 📈 Statistical Techniques

- **Descriptive Statistics**: To understand distributions and central tendencies  
- **Correlation Analysis**: To explore linear relationships  
- **Linear Regression**: To quantify influence on academic performance  
- **Cloud Utilization**: Leveraged Kaggle as a hosted dataset platform

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Positive correlation between **social support** and academic GPA  
- **Anxiety** shows a negative impact on performance, especially in high-stress students  
- **Sleep quality** is strongly linked with cognitive performance  
- Multivariate factors interact across domains—demonstrating need for holistic interventions

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project bridges data analysis with behavioral science. By revealing how different aspects of student life interrelate, it contributes to **data-informed educational interventions** that can support student well-being and success.
